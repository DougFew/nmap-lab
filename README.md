# nmap-Lab

## Objective

The scenario for this lab is to simulate the role of a security analyst tasked with performing a network scan using nmap to identify any potential vulnerabilites. I will use nmap to discover active hosts, operating systems, and ports and services running on the target system.

### Skills Learned

- Use nmap to discover information on a target and output the information to a file for further anlaysis.
- Verify installation of nmap and nmap version.

### Tools Used

- <ins>Kali Linux</ins> is the operating system used in this lab.
- <ins>Oracle VM VirtualBox</ins> is used to host the operating system.
- <ins>nmap</ins> is used to make various network scans.

## Steps

The first step is to verify the installation and version number of nmap. This image shows that namp version 7.80 is currently istalled.

Next, I scanned a machine set up by nmap to allow for testing scanning capabilities. In this example, it shows that four ports on the machine are set to "open" while 996 ports did not respond.
